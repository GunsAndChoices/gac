            Guns And Choices is set to become an Action-MMO-RPG that combines anime style with a great story and plenty of action. 
            The project originated as an idea between school friends who wanted to give game development a try.
            Currently, the game is still in the Pre-Alpha phase. Only developers have access to the game at this time.
